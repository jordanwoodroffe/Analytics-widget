## Things to note
- URL query params work and can control the table/ open the table with filters applied
- Sort is clickable and works, just gave it a minimalist design 

## Assets

- coding-challenge-ui - this is the front end (React + Typescript)
- coding-challnge-api - this is the backend (NodeJS, Typescript + Express)

### To run both:

`npm run dev`

### To run tests:

`npm run test`

## Requirements

- Provided is a wireframe for a widget (wireframe.jpeg) The application helps marketplace sellers with cross-marketplace data insights. The widget is a view of the orders that have been placed that are overdue for shipping.
- The data to populate the widget is provided in two .csv files (coding-challenge-api/data). The orders data is gzipped due to its size.
- Create an REST api that reads in data from the csv and returns it to the front-end
  in the appropriate format
- Create the required components on the front-end to match the wireframe
